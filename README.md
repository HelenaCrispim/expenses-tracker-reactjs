# expenses-tracker-reactjs
First project coded during Maximilian Schwarzm's complete ReactJS guide on Udemy.com
Althought the application itself is completed, there is still space for improvement which I entend to get to when I'm done with the rest of the course.
The updates planned include a Month Selection by clicking on months responsive bars, a functional database to store data and a better arrangment of the expenses,
placing expenses in order of most to least recent.
